<p id="hello" >	Hello our names are Aviv and Roy we are tenagers from the bay are we made this web site together (all though Aviv did all the technicals), we made this site so we can put our thoghts and things we made on this web site.</br>	We made this web site with 0$.</br> We did this by hosting our web site on <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and then getting a free domain on <a href="http://freenom.com" target="_blank">freenom.com</a>, these guys will give a free domain for up to 12 months but it will have a wierd ending like .tk or .cf.</br>	So this is how we made our web site and we hope you enjoy it! </p>
